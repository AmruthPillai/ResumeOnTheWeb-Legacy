# Amruth Pillai's Resume on the Web
A web interpretation of the resume I designed using Adobe Photoshop CC.  
This is a personal project just to keep my web design/development skills in check.

## I wanna see it in action!
You can visit a live version of this repository on GitHub Pages:

## How can I help?
Well, there are a number of ways where you could help me.  
First and foremost would be to follow me on GitHub, star/watch the interesting repositories.  
If you're well versed with web development, you could teach me better tricks on code optimization.  
If you're good with design aesthetics, you could help me redesign my resume to look more pleasing.  
If you're a good person, you could throw in a comment or two just to make me feel good :) *JK*

Thanks a lot for the support everybody! :)
