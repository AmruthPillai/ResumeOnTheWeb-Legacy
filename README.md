# Amruth Pillai's Resume on the Web
A web interpretation of the resume I designed using Adobe Photoshop CC.  
This is a personal project just to keep my web design/development skills in check.

## I wanna see it in action!
You can visit a live version of this repository on GitHub Pages:  
https://amruthpillai.github.io/ResumeOnTheWeb/

## How can I help?
Well, there are a number of ways where you could help me.  
First and foremost would be to follow me on GitHub, star/watch the interesting repositories.  
If you're well versed with web development, you could teach me better tricks on code optimization.  
If you're good with design aesthetics, you could help me redesign my resume to look more pleasing.  
If you're a good person, you could throw in a comment or two just to make me feel good :) *JK*

## Do you want to use it?
Well, I'm a nice guy, but there's no respect for nice guys in this world, so I'm reserved to use a license that enforces the same. You're allowed to fork the repository, you're allowed to modify it and demo it as your own, but with due credits in the footer. Removal of which will be considered a felony. **This repository is governed by the GNU General Public License v3.0**.

Thanks a lot for the support everybody! :)
